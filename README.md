# Cocktail Database

### Overview:

Project is built with React. Cocktail database using api fetch, React Router to navigate individual cocktail pages as well as other side application pages.

### Technologies used:

- React JS
- React Hooks
- React Context Api
- React Router
- Rest API
- Functional Programming
- Responsive Design

### Possible Future Improvements:

Implement the ability for users to register and add cocktails. As well as add ratings to cocktails so others can filter through cocktails by ratings. Additionally, I would implement a filtering system in the Search page in which the user can filter down based on several taxonomies such as category, alcohol type and ratings.

#### API Used: [The Cocktail DB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/)
